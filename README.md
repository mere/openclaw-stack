# OpenClaw Hetzner VPS (Opinionated)

This is a **work-in-progress** local repo on a throwaway VPS.

Goal: a repeatable, SSH-only OpenClaw deployment on Hetzner with:
- Docker Compose + systemd
- A visible browser desktop (noVNC) for manual logins
- CDP reachable **internally** by service name (e.g. `http://browser:9222`)
- A simple smoke test: open BBC and summarize headlines
